Hardware Info
==============
This file details specific results people are experiencing with different hardware, settings, and frequencies.

Note: Thank you for testing this out! Are you using an antenna? At the beginning, I placed the antenna directly on top of the number 4 key and that worked best. It was a round antenna. Then once I knew it works I moved the antenna back. Moving it back reduced the number of frequencies that it worked on, and eventually only that one (1580 kHz) worked. Different hardware will certainly have different frequency response. Here are some results that have been sent in by readers. Please mail sbr@phor.net with your results or [edit this file directly ](https://github.com/fulldecent/system-bus-radio/edit/master/HARDWARE-INFO.md) and create a pull request.
